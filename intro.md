## About Wallaroo

Wallaroo makes it easy for a developer to write a distributed streaming data application.  We expect developers that use Wallaroo to be experts in their domain, not distributed application architects.

When you take advantage of the Wallaroo library in your project, you get to leverage a variety of distributed streaming data application resources. This functionality includes exactly-once message processing guarantees, resilient state, topology management, and partitioning.

Developers only need to be concerned about domain logic of their particular application, leave the messy distributed application guts to Wallaroo.
