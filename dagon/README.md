# dagon

Alter reality... by setting up a topology. 

## Usage

At the moment, you need to manually compile spike and giles in their
respective folders before running dagon.

```python3.5 dagon.py duration [seed]```

Duration doesn't currently do anything, but it will set the duration of the run, 
after which test results from Giles will be available.
