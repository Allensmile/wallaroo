# dagon

Alter reality... by setting up a topology. 

## Usage

At the moment, you need to manually compile spike and giles in their
respective folders before running dagon.

```python3.5 dagon.py duration [seed]```

Duration doesn't currently do anything, but it will set the duration of the run, 
after which test results from giles will be available. The option seed parameter
seeds random number generators within spike.
