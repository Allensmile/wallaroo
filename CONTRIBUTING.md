## Public Visibility

*DO NOT COMMIT ANYTHING YOU/WE DO NOT WANT BECOMING PUBLIC LATER*.

At this time, this repo is private and not open to the public. However, at some
point we are going to open source all/parts of Buffy. The easiest way to do that
is to switch this repo from private to public. It is entirely possible that
anything you commit now will be made public later in commit comments, history
etc. 

## Commit Messages

Before contributing any code to this repo, please read 
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
And then, follow it. And remember, if you have time to commit code, you have
time to write a good commit message; that includes you Sean.
