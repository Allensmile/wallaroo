# Core Concepts

In this section, we are going to introduce you to the core concepts of Wallaroo that you will be working with when you use our APIs. This section is designed to get you "thinking in Wallaroo".

We've tried to keep "Core Concepts" as language agnostic as possible. There are times when a problem is best illustrated by example code. When code is used, we've opted to go for examples in Pony rather than C++ or Python. We feel that C++ code could be hard for Python developers to following along with and Python examples would omit type information that can be helpful and would otherwise have to be supplied in text.
