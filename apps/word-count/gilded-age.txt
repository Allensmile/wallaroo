It will be seen that it deals with an entirely ideal state of society
and the chief embarrassment of the writers in this realm of the
imagination has been the want of illustrative examples In a State where
there is no fever of speculation no inflamed desire for sudden wealth
where the poor are all simple-minded and contented and the rich are all
honest and generous where society is in a condition of primitive purity
and politics is the occupation of only the capable and the patriotic
there are necessarily no materials for such a history as we have
constructed out of an ideal commonwealth

No apology is needed for following the learned custom of placing
attractive scraps of literature at the heads of our chapters It has
been truly observed by Wagner that such headings with their vague
suggestions of the matter which is to follow them pleasantly inflame the
reader interest without wholly satisfying his curiosity and we will
hope that it may be found to be so in the present case
